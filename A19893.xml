            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:15668:4"/> after for the general good of many turned into the Latin: I thought it a thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge moſt worthy my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſpend ſome time in tranſlating it into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishe, and to preſent your ſelfe with the firſt fruites thereof. Which burthen to vndergoe, two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal cauſes haue chiefly moued me. The one the great affection and loue which I beare to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the B.

<pb facs="tcp:15668:4"/> charitably compoſed.

And althoughe there were many that might of right challenge greater matters from me then this, yet your ſelfe ſeemed moſt worthy to be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with al the right that I could chalenge in this worke.

                     <p>The ſecond remedie.

Conſider how longe I haue moſt familiarly vſed thee, by conuerſing with thee in the moſt B.

                     <p>Firſt therefore the principal ſigne and token of true loue, is an earneſt deſire moſt nerely to ioyne, and as it were to ingrafte our ſelues into the thinge which we entirely loue. This ſigne how liuely
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:15668:46"/> it appeared in Chriſt, is made plaine and manifeſt in the inſtitution of the moſt B.

Sacrament. And this vnion is made by participation of one ſpirit, in him that receiueth, and him that is receiued, whereof enſueth one maner of life and conuerſation.</p>
                     <p>An other ſigne is, to doe wel vnto him whom we loue. And when he that loueth beſtoweth his hart on him whom he loueth, he hath nothinge left which moſt willingly he would not beſtowe vpon him: now then, what greater thing could be thought on or imagined, then that which Chriſt imparteth vnto vs in the moſt B.

And euen as our ſoule, ſo ſoone at it was conioyned with that flesh and blood which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued

                     <p>Thirdly, thoſe who entirely loue the one the other, wil euer the one be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the other: and therefore if at any time they be ſeuered or parted, yet leaue they alwayes ſome token of remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, which may preſerue and renewe their loue. The like ſigne of loue is this moſt B.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:15668:47"/> I haue ſuffered for you.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the partie who loueth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiereth loue againe. And this ſigne haue we alſo of the loue of Chriſt, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiering ſo greatly to be beloued of vs, hath inſtituted this ſacred and miſtical banquet, conſecrated with ſuch diuine wordes, that he who worthely freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth the ſame, is preſently wounded with loue and admiration of his vnſpeakable goodnes.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, the louer deſiereth to pleaſe his beloued, and ſtudieth by al meanes poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how to effect the ſame; euen as tender parents doe to their deere and beloued children: our B.

                     <p>Now conſider I beſeeche thee at what time our moſt louing Lord &amp; Sauiour or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained this banquet, to wit, at his laſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when shorly after he was to ſuffer thoſe moſt bitter torments, which already his cruel enimies had prepared for him. So that when they were inuenting moſt sharpe paines for him, then did he prouide
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:15668:47"/> this moſt heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly foode for vs. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were mingling for him bitter gaule, then was he tempering for vs moſt ſweete honie.

                     <p>The louer houldeth the abſence of his beloued as a torment vnto him, alwayes deſireing the preſence of his loue. For this is the effect of true and perfect loue, that it ſtil deſiereth to be vnited to that it loueth, thereby to receiue contentment and delight: euen ſo our diuine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly louer, our Lord IESVS, hath inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and ordained this admirable Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which him ſelfe is really preſent; that ſo longe as this Sacrament should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in the worlde, he him ſelfe would alſo remaine therein, notwithſtanding that he is aſcended into heauen.

                     <head>Why al that come to receiue the B. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, receiue not the ſvveete and heauenly conſolations contained therein.</head>
                     <p>THe firſt reaſon is, the defect and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of him that receiueth it, for that he cometh not duely prepared. For as a blinde man depriued of ſighte, is not capable of the lighte of the Sunne, shine it neuer ſo brighte: euen ſo the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual taſt of many, is ſo corrupted with earthly delightes, that it neuer findeth the ſweetnes of the B.

                        <hi>The ſenſual man</hi> (that is he who is carried away with his ſenſual appetites) <hi>perceiueth not thoſe thinges vvhich are of the ſpirit of God.</hi>

For he, who not meditatinge on the diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of it, doth ſoddainly ſwallowe it downe, muſt of neceſſitie be deſtitute of al ſpiritual taſt and comfort contained therein, as alſo he who doth not applie it

Therefore that thou maieſt finde the ſweetnes of this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial foode, thou oughteſt carefully to ponder with thy ſelfe the greatnes of this miſterie, and to cal to God for his diuine helpe and aſſiſtance, that thorough true vnderſtanding and deuout contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thou maieſt attaine to the perfect taſte thereof.</p>

                     <head>Four thinges to be conſidered in this most B. Sacrament.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>GVlielmus Pariſienſis</hi> an excellent learned man, ſaieth, that there are foure thinges eſpecially to be conſidered in the B. Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The admirable and omnipotent power of Almightie God, who doth beyonde the reaſon of humaine capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, change the viſible ſubſtance of bread and wine, into the inuiſible body and blood of Chriſt, leauing thoſe external formes, whollie depriued of their natural ſubiect.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The prudence and wiſdome of almightie God, who prouideth for our ſoules ſuch conuenient meate; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the external formes of bread and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:15668:56"/> wine inuitinge vs to come ſecurely to this ſacred table.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The infinite abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his diuine goodnes, whereby he offereth vnto vs this heauenly foode, with ſuch exceedinge cheerefulnes and alacritie.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The great and vnſpeakable mercie of God, who ſpared not his only and deerely beloued Sonne, but deliuered him to a moſt cruel and shameful death, that thereby euen in this life we might haue perpetual ioy in our ſoules. O worke moſt worthie of al admiration, the which ſo often as we attentiuely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is able to leaue vs altogether aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore not to feele ſweetenes in the B. Sacrament, proceedeth of the litle account made of venial ſinnes, wittinglie commmitted. For the true effect of this Sacrament is to giue new conſolation and refection to a pure and cleane ſoule; but al venial ſinnes of what condition ſoeuer they be, are wholy oppoſite to this puritie and brightnes, and doe hinder and let al actual deuotion, which is moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to be had, to attaine to the taſte and ſweetenes of this diuine miſterie. So that this may ſtande for an infallible grounde, that by daylie committing of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:15668:57"/> venial ſinnes, we are diſabled from taſting the ſweetenes of the B. Sacrament. Let vs therefore flye from ſinne as from a moſt infectious peſtilence, and humbly craue of almightie God, that it wil pleaſe him to giue vs ſuch a wil and deſire, that rather we may chooſe to ſuffer any cruel death, then willingly to commit the leaſt venial offence.</p>

                     <head>Three thinges to be remembred concerninge the bodie of Christ, at ſuch time as vve receiue the holie Sacrament.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. THe firſt is: The eternal loue where with God loued vs, before we had any being, thorough which he prouided for vs, al thinges that were needful, and alſo created vs to his owne image and likenes. For this cauſe we are for euer bound to render and yeeld vnto him, al hartie and continual thankes, to the vtmoſt we are able.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond is: The ineſtimable loue that the Sonne of God shewed towardes vs, who being in the heauenly delightes and glorie of his Father, yet would vouchſafe to take vpon him, thoſe griefes and miſeries, which thorough <hi>Adams</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence were due vnto vs; as hunger, thirſt, cold, wearines, shame, paine, and the like: and laſtly would ſuffer a moſt reproachful death, thereby to free vs from eternal damnation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third is: The inſearchable loue, where with at al times our moſt merciful Sauiour loueth vs, and the exceeding care and prouidence where with he doth
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:15668:59"/> alwayes gouerne vs: and that he who is our Creator, our Redeemer, and moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire louinge Brother, preſenteth him ſelfe before his heauenly Father, and doth ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite and pleade our cauſe, as our moſte careful Aduocate.</p>
                     <p>Theſe three thinges ought we euer to haue fixed before our eies (as that moſt B. woman hath directed vs) but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at ſuch times as we shal be preſent, and receiue that moſt heauenly banquet, which our moſt merciful Redeemer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon vs, in his laſt wille and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of his great loue towardes vs. The memorie whereof, we ought euer to retaine with moſt thankful mindes for ſo great a benefit. This the B. <hi>Mechtildis</hi> knewe likewiſe by the inſtinct of the Holie Ghoſt: that when any buſie them ſelues with thinkinge on worldlie and idle occaſions, that they doe contaminate the image of the B. Trinitie, that is to ſay, the bewtie of their ſoule; as alſo if they be conuerſant in curious and worldly wiſdome, ſetting their delightes on vaine and tranſitorie thinges. And conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe that ſo longe as the ſoule is impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned in this earthlie bodie of ours, it doth often defile it ſelfe with baſe and earthlie cogitations: therefore it behoueth
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:15668:59"/> that we oft reflect our eies vpon the glaſſe of Gods diuine countenance, but eſpecially at ſuch time as we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the moſt B. Sacrament. And euen as the pureſt white, being made redd with blushing, doth exceedingly adorne the face with beautie: ſo ought we, often to make white and pure the face of our ſoule with Confeſſion, and as it were to dye it with redd, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the bitter paſſion of our moſt merciful Redeemer.</p>

                     <p>THis B. Sacrament is called, <hi>Our daylie bread,</hi> becauſe ether it is to be receiued daylie, or that we ought ſo to direct our liues, that we may daylie be worthy to receiue it. The ſame author ſaieth. Let ſuch men, as ſay that we ought but ſeldome to frequent this Sacrament,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:15668:64"/> heare and marke dilligently the wordes of <hi>S. Ambroſe. This bread is called our daylie bread: vvhy then comest thou to receiue it after a yeare?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is further noted, that before our Sauiour deliuered his B. body to his Apoſtles, although they were cleane, yet that firſt he washed their feete: thereby to shew vs, what great diligence and care we ought to vſe, to procure integritie and innocencie of minde, when we are to receiue this ſacred miſterie. For as the Arke of God (then the which nothing was euer more pretious amongſt the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp; by the which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued moſt ſingular benefits) being taken from them, brought vnto the <hi>Philistians</hi> moſt greiueous calamities, together with eternal reproach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie: ſo likewiſe this holie Sacrament, hath moſt contrarie operations, in thoſe that worthelie and vnworthelie receiue it; euen as wholſome meates, which doe nourish and comfort the ſtomach wel diſpoſed, yet much offend the bodie filled with corrupted humors. Wherupon <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith. <hi>Therefore amongſt you many are infirme, and many ſleepe:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> becauſe they come vnworthely to this ſacred Table.</p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:15668:65"/>
                     <p>The ſame Author teacheth vs beſides, that the firſt preparation that we are to make, is, to diſcerne table from table; that is the true heauenly foode from that which is counterfeit. The which we doe, when firmely we beleeue to be preſent, the real bodie, and blood of Chriſt; him whom the Angelles adore in heauen; at whoſe beck, the verie heauens doe trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and with whoſe glorie, both heauen and earth are replenished. And this is to diſcerne the bodie of our Lord, as the Apoſtle admonisheth; the greatnes of which miſterie, we ought rather to ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re with humilitie, then vainly and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſlie to ſearch into.</p>
                     <p>An other preparation is there, of no leſſe neceſſitie, which is, that euery man call him ſelfe to a moſt ſtrict account, whether truly, and vnfeinedly he loue his neighbour. For if thou doeſt finde in thy ſelfe, the leaſt hatred or grudge againſt thy neigbour, this muſt thou wholie lay aſide, &amp; firſt reconcile thy ſelfe vnto him. Next if thy conſcience accuſe thee of any mortal ſinne, it muſt be purged by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and Conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Further we muſt remember how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie we are of ſo great a benefit. Therfore often are we to repeate that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:15668:65"/> ſaying of the <hi>Centurion,</hi> which was ſo highlie praiſed and commended of our Sauiour.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Lorde I am not vvorthie thou ſhouldeſt enter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Alſo we muſt dilligently examin our ſelues, whether we may preſume to vſe that ſaying of S. <hi>Peter.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iohn.</hi> 22.</note> 
                        <hi>Lord thou knovveſt that I loue thee.</hi> For we muſt remember he which preſumed to come to the feaſt of our Lord,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Nether is it ſufficient, to vſe only the preparation of the mind, but alſo of the body. For we muſt come to the B. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Altar faſting; in ſuch ſorte, that we nether eate nor drinke any kinde of ſuſtenance, from the midnight of the day before we come to receiue.

And that it is vnlike, that the shirte thould be more pure, that is washed but once in the yeare, then that which is duely washed once euery weeke.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fourthlie, he obiecteth that it is vnpoſſible for any to abſtaine ſo wholly from ſinne, that they may worthelie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire ſo often to the B. Sacrament: euer concealing, how many hereby are reclaimed from their vices, which before they were accuſtomed daylie to commit. He alſo laboureth to hide
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:15668:71"/> from them, that by the benefit of this moſt heauenly foode, a man is made more chaſte, humble, merciful, patient, a diſpiſer of wordly vanities, couragious to ſuffer aduerſities for Gods cauſe, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and perſeuerant in al vertuous exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Fiftly he ſuggeſteth into their min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des many cauilles and doubtes about the B. Sacrament. As whether the verie body of Chriſt be, or be not, really preſent: and how it is there. And ſome perſons he doth ſo trouble with theſe kindes of ſcruples, eſpecially at the time when they are prepared to receiue, that they whollie refraine from cominge thereunto. In the meane time he concealeth the admirable effectes which daylie happen by oft fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the ſame: for many, who before were blinde in diuine miſteries, receiue their ſight: the deafe receiue their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe: the lame doe walke cheerefully in the way of our Lord: the Leapers, and ſuch as are defiled with the ſinne of the flesh, become chaſt liuers: and ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were buried in deadly ſinne, had now rather chooſe to die any corporal death, then wittingly to commit the leaſt offence. And whence proceedeth this great alteration of the right hand of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:15668:71"/> higeſt, if there be not the true humanitie and diuinitie, of our Sauiour Chriſt the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein contayned?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Sixtly, he obiecteth ſo many vnclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne thoughtes and fowle dreames, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the night before they come to the holie Communion, that thereby he doth afright many from frequenting the ſame. Wherupon we reade that an ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euer the nighte before he purpoſed to receiue, had pollution of his body; which he notinge in time to be a practiſe of the diuel, would in deſpite of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teltie come to the holie Communion, &amp; ſo after this, he ceaſed to be troubled.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Seuenthly he ſetteth before their eies the defectes and imperfections of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me that frequent the B. Sacrament, and by their diſorderly liuing giue ſcandal vnto others, neuer manifeſting in the meane ſpace, how miraculouſlie infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are therby reclaimed. And by this example it should conſequently followe, that they should vſe nether wine, nor ſworde, knife, nor any ſuch neceſſarie thinge, becauſe there be diuers perſons that doe abuſe them.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Eightly he obiecteth, that often frequenting the B. Sacrament, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much familiaritie there with, bredeth in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:15668:72"/> vs a contempt. To which obiection may wel be anſwered: that he which hath not familiaritie with God, hath familiaritie with the diuel, remembring that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt ſaieth. <hi>He that is not with me, is against me.</hi> And againe if God wil haue vs to cal him Father, he wil alſo haue familiaritie betwixt him ſelfe and vs. Wherupon it followeth, that not all familiaritie cauſeth contempte, but that only which is contracted betwixt men ſubiect to imperfections, by reaſon that men are wonte to obſerue the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of others, for which defectes they often growe into contempt: but in God who is perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſelfe, no leſt imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can be obſerued: and therefore the B. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells in heauen, which doe alwayes aſiſte and attend him moſt familiarly, doe alſo with al reuerence adore &amp; worship him.</p>

                     <p>IT is verie neceſſarie that the penitent obſerue that forme of Confeſſion which, shal be preſcribed vnto him by his ghoſtly Father: euen as in matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the health of our bodies, we are careful to followe the preſcript of our Phiſition; eſpecially conſidering our Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition may erre, &amp; often erreth in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines he preſcribeth: but God (as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth that holie woman <hi>S.

Secondly, of the ſinnes which haue paſt his mouth, as of lies, and vntruthes, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe whether they haue bene ſpoken ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſedly or vnaduiſedly; and of al his idle wordes, detractions, &amp;c. Thirdly, of the watche &amp; cuſtodie of his ſenſes. Fourthly of his deedes and actions according to his degree and vocation. Fiftly, that he hath

That he hath not bene ſo thankful to God as he ought to be, for al ſuch benefitts as he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of him.

                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Caietan</hi> in his <hi>Summe</hi> ſaieth, that he who regardeth not venial ſinnes, hath no great care of his ſoule, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraudeth him ſelſe of many great benefits.

For which cauſe, as a man doth noth feare only death, but alſo the leaſt diſtemper that may happen to his bodie, as colde or any other litle diſeaſe: ſo ought he alſo greatly to feare, leaſt he fall into any venial ſinne. Further he compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth mortal ſinne, as if we ſhould kill a litle birde, and venial ſinne, as if we ſhould clip hir winges that ſhe could not flye, or mount aloft as before ſhe was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed: and then adioyneth, that as an euil woman is not at the firſt peruerted, but by degrees is corrupted and becometh naught, ſo by venial ſinnes, as by ſteppes and degrees, we fall in the end into the greateſt euils. And againe, euen as a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not at the firſt worne olde, but is defaced and conſumed in tracte of time: and as houſes decay not, and fall downe at once, but growe ruinous and olde by continuance: ſo fareth it with men in the exerciſe of a ſpritual life, if they be not careful of venial ſinnes.
